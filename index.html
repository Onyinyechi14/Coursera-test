    <h2>
        <p>For the Love of christ constraineth us,(2 corinthian 5 vs 14), just like John 3 vs 16 
           that says for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whose-ever believes
           will not perish but have everlasting life.</p>
        <p>God loves us so much that was why he sent his son to come die for us not because we are deserving of 
            it but because that his who he is(Aloving father) so even when we do not accept him, he still &nbsp;loves 
            us and die for us.
