   <h2> HOW MY DAY WENT</h2>
  <p> Today started with prayer as always thanking God for the gift of a new day, afterwhich l played a little with hubby and went straight to the kitchen to make breakfast cos an hungry man and woman are ulcer patient. I mad potato and egg sauce but wasn't sweet and so we didn't eat it well. After resting, I went to the kitchen again to cook and this time l want to cook rice and soup concurrectly on a seperate pot. See you again, BYE.</p>
  <p> I am back, who missed me. so after making the soup and rice, we eat rice for lunch, the rice was prepared like this local palm oil rice with dry fish and others, I must say we enjoyed it</p>
