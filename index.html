    <title>HOW MY DAY WENT</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p> Today started with prayer as always thanking God for the gift of a new day, afterwhich l played a little with hubby and went straight to the kitchen to make breakfast cos an hungry man and woman are ulcer patient. I mad potato and egg sauce but wasn't sweet and so we didn't eat it well. After resting, I went to the kitchen again to cook and this time l want to cook rice and soup concurrectly on a seperate pot. See you again, BYE.</p>
